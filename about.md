# What does it do

This mod allows your inputs to register in between visual frames, which drastically increases input precision on low framerates like 60FPS. \
It's similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide, but with much less lag and (hopefully) far fewer physics-related bugs.

# How to use

If the icon is automatically jumping when you respawn, disable the "Stop Triggers on Death" hack in Mega Hack.

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right. \
To enable right click input, use the mod options menu. \
You must enable num lock to use numpad keys.

It is recommended to use either Physics Bypass or one of these FPS values: 60, 80, 120, or 240. \
This is because 2.2 has stutters on FPS values that aren't factors or multiples of 240 unless you enable Physics Bypass.

Disable TPS Bypass/Draw Divide when using this mod, because they're pointless.

The mod comes with its own version of Physics Bypass in the mod options (on Windows/Linux). Be warned that not all lists or leaderboards that allow CBF will consider this legit!

If on Linux, and the mod doesn't work, please try running the command <cr>sudo usermod -aG input $USER</c> (this will make your system slightly less secure).
