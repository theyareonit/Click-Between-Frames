# Click Between Frames (CBF)

## What Does CBF Do

This mod allows your inputs to register in between visual frames, drastically increasing input precision at low framerates, such as 60 FPS. It is similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide, but with significantly less lag and fewer physics-related bugs.

## How to Use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
To enable right click input, use the mod options menu.

For best input precision, use either Physics Bypass (with any FPS value), or one of the following FPS values: 60, 80, 120, 240.
Other FPS values will have worse input precision without Physics Bypass, due to how 2.2's physics work.

Disable TPS Bypass/Draw Divide when using this mod, because they're pointless.

## Known Issues

- This mod does not work with existing bots.
- Follow triggers will stutter for 1 frame after clicking.
- Moving platforms have strange physics in platformer mode.
- Controller input is not yet supported.
