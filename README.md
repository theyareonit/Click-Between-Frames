# Installation

Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) for Windows, then install this mod from the Geode index.

# What does it do

This mod allows your inputs to register in between visual frames, which drastically increases input precision on low framerates like 60FPS.
It's similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide, but with much less lag and far fewer physics-related bugs.

# How to use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
When using mouse, left click is player 1, and right click is player 2.

For best input precision, use either MHv8 Physics Bypass or one of the following FPS values: 60, 80, 120, 240.
Any other FPS values (without Physics Bypass) will provide poor results, due to how 2.2's physics work.

Disable TPS Bypass/Draw Divide when using this mod, because they're pointless.

# Known issues

- Touch triggers don't have subframe precision
- Moving platforms have strange physics in platformer mode
- Lock 2p controls is not yet supported
- Swap 2p controls is not yet supported (use rebinds instead)
