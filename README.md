# Installation

Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) for Windows, then install this mod from the Geode index.

# What does it do

This mod allows your inputs to register in between visual frames, which drastically increases input precision on low framerates like 60FPS.
It's similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide, but with much less lag and (hopefully) far fewer physics-related bugs.

# How to use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
To enable right click input, use the mod options menu.

It is recommended to use either Physics Bypass or one of these FPS values: 60, 80, 120, or 240.
This is because 2.2 stutters on FPS values that aren't factors of 240 unless you have Physics Bypass.

Disable TPS Bypass/Draw Divide when using this mod, because they're pointless.

The mod comes with its own version of Physics Bypass in the mod options. Be warned that not all lists or leaderboards that allow CBF will consider this legit!
